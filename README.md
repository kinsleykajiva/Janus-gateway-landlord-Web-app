## Janus-gateway-landlord-Web-app


This is a Web app that seeks to make it very easy to use Janus Gateway.The app handles installation , setting up/ Updating configurations from just a single install of this .

Motivation: As a developer I got tired of always opening the console to see logs and make configs all the time using the console .


# Requirements
- JDK 17+ to run . 
- Better with GraalVM
- make sure you have snap installed.
- This so far has been built and tested on Ubuntu,please try to make changes to suite your OS.


# Installation :
You can pull the repository, make a build , navigate to target folder .
- When you build its recommended  that you build a native build to leverage on performance and app size (so far the app is smaller than 100MB).
- To build Native App : ```  ./mvnw package -Dpackaging=native-image```
- To run the newly built native app ``cd Janus-gateway-landlord-Web-app/target`` and run ``` sudo ./Janus-gateway-landlord-Web-app  ``` 
- When you run the app try to run the native app or jar app as or with admin privileges to allow the app to execute admin related tasks.
